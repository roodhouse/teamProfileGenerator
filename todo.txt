2. setup jest
    - try to run the tests -- not really working
3. setup inquierer 
    - re-create questions and promises etc 
        - how to setup inquirer to prompt a new set of questions based on a multiple choice answer? - stuck here
5. begin to write tests in jest 
6. how to not overwrite the entire document? 
    - what other modules does the file system have? 
        - append? 

        first qustion asks which type you would like to add
        at the end of adding ask if they want to add more
            if yes then rerun the main()
                if no then run .then and write the file...


                if no then run a different function that has inquier.prompt().then(answers) - here
